# MultiTaskingScreen
A screen with settings to change the screen lol

This is just a screen where you can change some
stats of the screen and the text inside

You can use the buttons blueprint at Screen1 with
the hashmap to create better and cleaner buttons
at your later projects

This was my homework for school but in better lol
